# Numerical-Solutions-of-1D-Wave-Equation-with-Boundary-Value
Since the wave equation is a second-order differential equation with bias, it usually does not have a general or fixed formula to calculate the actual expression of the wave equation. In this report, we are going to fit the wave equation by numerical analysis, and specifically we will accomplish these two main tasks.:
- How to estimate the partial derivatives numerically and to ensure that the error range is small.
- How to construct a set of sparse system of linear equations and solve them numerically to find the solutions of the linear equations.

By solving the above tasks, we can demonstrate that by using numerical analysis, we can fit the wave equation well within a reasonable range of error, thus effectively helping us to explore the properties of the wave equation.
